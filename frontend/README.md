# Frontend: Cluster Display And Search

This project is an Electron application based on [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

It serves as the frontend for the Apple Notes analysis tools, providing features such as:

- **Cluster Display**: Visualizing the clusters generated by the backend analysis.
- **Search**: Interface for searching through notes and analysis results.

## Backend Requirement

This frontend application relies on backend routes to function. **Ensure the FastAPI backend server is running** before interacting with the app.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the backend server, please refer to the [main project README](../README.md).
